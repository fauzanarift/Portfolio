# Software Quality Assurance Portfolio

### About me
Greetings, my name is Fauzan. I'm a tech enthusiast with various roles of tech positions and currently as a Software Quality Assurance. My exposure of digital technology and internet from early age motivates me to learn more about it. I would like to share my knoweledge as a SQA and showcase my sample of practical skills that I've worked on through e-courses, self study, and my jobs.

Here's my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fauzanarift/)

### My experience
As I mentioned before, I've been working on various tech roles on various companies. While my first job is a Junior Web Developer, I'd like to widen my horizon about project management skills and phase thus my latest job now is a Quality Assurance. On smaller scale, web developer also includes the quality checking, but with more complex project, overseeing project as a QA is my choice.
